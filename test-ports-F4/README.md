This exercises each available port on the processor, aimed specifically at
the STAMP board based on the ET-ARM-STAMP. The ports are set to digital output
and toggled.

This allows an LED or meter to be used to identify the correct working of the
pin. The process can be operated at higher speed for use of a CRO.

Suitable for the STM32F4xx series of processors.
The processor tested was the STM32F405RGT6 1K Flash, 128K RAM.
