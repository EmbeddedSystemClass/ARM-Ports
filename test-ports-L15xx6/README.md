This exercises each available port on the processor, aimed specifically at
the STAMP board based on the ET-ARM-STAMP. The ports are set to digital output
and toggled, then some are set to digital inputs while the remaining outputs are
toggled to check for shorts between pins.

This allows an LED or meter to be used to identify the correct working of the
pin. The process can be operated at higher speed for use of a CRO.

Suitable for the STM32L15x series of processors.
The processors tested were the STM32L151R6T6 and the STM32L151RET6.
